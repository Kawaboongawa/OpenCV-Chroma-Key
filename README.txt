Hello there, 

I spent definitively too much time on this project, but IÂ must admit the topic was
fascinating and even now I decided to stop to go forward even though I still want to keep
going.

My project might not have every part you asked for, however I think it does quite the job, despite some
flaws I'll describe in details later. I implemented most of the method given by the thesis you gave
"Robust Chroma Keying System based on Human Visual Perception and Statistical Color Models".

It includes background and foreground extraction, dominant color analysis and unknown pixels color and alpha estimation.

The program is a bit slow (5~/10 FPS) and the alpha estimation function is not perfect at all when it comes to transparent materials
such as a dress.

However It'll perform well on foreground without transparent materials.

Best regards,

Cyril Cetre
