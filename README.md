# OPENCV Chroma Keying 

This is a project done during OpenCV courses. I did a real-time Chroma keying software partly based on "Robust Chroma Keying System Based on Human Visual Perception and Statistical Color Models" thesis by Wenyi Wang. This project has still some flaws. First, it cannot process more than 10 images per seconds for 1920X1080 images. Second, its evaluation function still need to be corrected to give satisfactory results.

However it gives great overview of what we can perform with openCV.
